<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Full of business ideas for apps and webpages, and so tired of not being able to realise these goals on my own, I
  have decided to study code to enable me to create some of these brilliant (if I do say so myself) ideas. 
</p>

<p>What you see here is the humble beginnings of my new life venture. I am struggling to find anyone to show some 
  belief in me atm, excluding my superstar husband, and I am finding that somewhat disappointing. However, I do work 
  very well when driven by a need to prove myself. Here's to all the haters! Thanks for the motivation to help me begin my dream. 
</p>

<p>Ok, so why is this so important to me? Well, I now have two little girls. I am on a personal mission to establish a 
  financial stability for myself and in turn, them. My primary goal in life at this time to to have the financial ability 
  to put my two girls through their secondary education. This may include a vehicle, depending where their studies take them, 
  or it may include an apartment of some variety - hopefully my secondary goal of Property Moguel can just house them.

  One step at a time, ammi right?
